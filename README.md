2. **Choose Your Path**:
   - **New to Morse Code?** Start with the Koch Method tab
   - **Need a Reference?** Use the Reference tab to look up characters

### For Beginners (Koch Method)
1. Click the **🎯 Koch Method** tab
2. Start with **Lesson 1** (K and M)
3. Press **🚀 Start Practice**
4. Listen to the morse code tone
5. Press the corresponding letter on your keyboard
6. Aim for 90%+ accuracy before moving to the next lesson

### For Reference
1. Click the **📚 Reference** tab
2. Adjust playback speed with the slider (5-30 WPM)
3. Click **🔊 Play** on any character to hear its morse code

## 📖 Koch Method Explanation

The Koch method is the most effective way to learn morse code, developed by Ludwig Koch in the 1930s. Key principles:

- **Full Speed Learning**: Characters are taught at target speed (15+ WPM) from day one
- **Progressive Character Introduction**: Start with 2 very different characters, add one at a time
- **Recognition Focus**: Emphasizes instant character recognition rather than counting dots/dashes
- **No Bad Habits**: Avoids slow learning that creates counting dependencies

### Lesson Progression
```
Lesson 1:  K, M
Lesson 2:  K, M, R  
Lesson 3:  K, M, R, S
Lesson 4:  K, M, R, S, U
Lesson 5:  K, M, R, S, U, A
...and so on through 27 lessons
```

**Why This Order?** Characters are introduced based on:
- Distinctly different sound patterns
- Common usage frequency
- Psychological learning principles

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Audio System
- **Library**: Tone.js for Web Audio API
- **Frequency**: 600Hz sine wave (standard morse tone)
- **Timing**: Proper dot/dash ratios (1:3) and spacing
- **WPM Calculation**: Uses standard PARIS timing method

### Browser Support
- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Requirements**: Web Audio API support
- **No Installation**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript

### Key Components
```javascript
// Morse timing calculation
dotDuration = 1.2 / WPM

// Standard ratios
dot: 1 unit
dash: 3 units  
element gap: 1 unit
letter gap: 3 units
```

## 🎹 Keyboard Controls

### Koch Method Practice
- **Any Letter Key**: Submit your answer during practice
- **ESC**: Stop current practice session (future enhancement)

### Navigation
- **Tab/Shift+Tab**: Navigate between interface elements
- **Enter/Space**: Activate buttons and controls

## 📊 Scoring System

### Accuracy Metrics
- **Correct**: Number of correctly identified characters
- **Total**: Total characters attempted  
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct answers

### Learning Goals
- **Beginner**: Aim for 70%+ accuracy
- **Intermediate**: Target 85%+ accuracy
- **Advanced**: Achieve 95%+ accuracy before advancing

## 🎨 Design Features

### Visual Design
- **Modern Gradient Background**: Professional blue gradient theme
- **Glass Morphism**: Translucent cards with backdrop blur
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Accessibility**: High contrast colors and clear typography

### User Experience
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear tab-based interface
- **Visual Feedback**: Immediate success/error indicators
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed as needed
- **No Installation**: Works directly in browser

## 🔄 Practice Workflow

### Typical Learning Session
1. **Select Appropriate Lesson**: Based on current skill level
2. **Start Practice**: Begin character recognition exercises  
3. **Listen Actively**: Focus on sound patterns, not counting
4. **Respond Quickly**: Type what you hear immediately
5. **Review Results**: Check accuracy and identify weak characters
6. **Advance Carefully**: Move up only after consistent success

### Best Practices
- **Short Sessions**: 10-15 minutes for optimal retention
- **Consistent Practice**: Daily sessions more effective than long cramming
- **Master Before Advancing**: 90%+ accuracy recommended
- **Focus on Weak Characters**: Repeat lessons if needed

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Custom Lesson Creation**: Build personalized character sets
- **Progress Tracking**: Save learning history and statistics
- **Speed Ramping**: Gradually increase WPM within lessons
- **Word Training**: Progress from characters to common words
- **Prosign Support**: Add morse prosigns (AR, SK, BT, etc.)
- **Dark/Light Themes**: User preference themes
- **Export Progress**: Download learning statistics

### Advanced Training Modes
- **QSO Simulation**: Practice realistic radio conversations
- **Contest Mode**: High-speed character recognition
- **Callsign Practice**: Amateur radio callsign training
- **Number Groups**: Random number sequence practice
